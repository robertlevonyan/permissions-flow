A simple library to make it easy requesting permissions in Android using Kotlin Coroutines.

## Setup

Add following line of code to your project level gradle file

```kotlin
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
```

#### Gradle:

Add following line of code to your module (app) level gradle file:

```groovy
    implementation 'com.robertlevonyan.components:PermissionsFlow:<LATEST-VERSION>'
```

#### Kotlin:

```kotlin
    implementation("com.robertlevonyan.components:PermissionsFlow:$LATEST_VERSION")
```

#### Maven:

```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.robertlevonyan.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>PermissionsFlow</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST-VERSION</version>
    <type>pom</type>
  </dependency>
```

### For Jetpack Compose
```kotlin
    implementation("com.robertlevonyan.components:permission-compose:0.0.1")
```

### Usage:

Permission flow offers 2 simple extension functions - both for for activities/fragments:

```kotlin
    requestPermissions(vararg permissionsToRequest: String)
    requestEachPermissions(vararg permissionsToRequest: String)
```

Both functions do request all permissions passed to them - the first one emits a list of `Permissions`, the second one flattens the permissions.

Here's a full code example like it would look like in an activity:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
 
    CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
        // just call requestPermission and pass in all required permissions
        requestPermissions(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
            .collect { permissions ->
                // here you get the result of the requests, permissions holds a list of Permission requests and you can check if all of them have been granted:
                val allGranted = permissions.find { !it.isGranted } == null
                // or iterate over the permissions and check them one by one
                permissions.forEach { 
                	val granted = it.isGranted
                	// ...
                }
            }
	}
}
```

### For Jetpack Compose
```kotlin
    @Composable
    fun AppContent() {
        val permissionState = rememberPermissionState(listOf(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)) { granted ->
            // do something awesome
        }
    
        // ...

        permissionState.launchPermissionRequest()
    }
```

## That's it!

With only few simple steps you can request permissions without splitting your code or overriding functions.
